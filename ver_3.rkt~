Proposal :

               1. It is a single player game. 

               2. It is a game which ramps up as and when a user completes a given level. 

               3. Two different shaped objects come from two sides of the screen. 

               4. Centre region is blacked out. 

               5. User can see the two objects until it enters the centre (defined region) 

               6. He has to click a button the exact time at which the two objects collide. ( Calculate and Guess )

               7. If he guess's it right he advances to the next level. Else he'll be asked to play the same level again. 

               8. If he doesn't click and the objects leave the screen new objects will come. 

               9. Or if presses the button at the wrong time. We can display an error message and show an option to replay the same level. 

               10. The level increases by speeding up the pace at which objects come in and by increasing the size of the void region. 

               11. Will create multiple shaped objects and try to make sure that two same objects never come together.
                   The object selection will be randomized.
